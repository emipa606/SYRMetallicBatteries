## **Adds batteries made of different metals with different stats**

Seven batteries are added, each requiring different materials and providing different benefits. Some of them are locked behind additional research. The uranium battery even comes with special mechanics, watch out!

The vanilla battery, costs more steel but also has higher capacity.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/5ACtbeg.png) Silver battery
Improved in all areas, costs silver in addition to base materials. Very cost-efficient.

High efficiency, normal capacity. Allows you to have less energy production overall due to high efficiency.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/wU8zGZO.png) Plasteel battery
Normal efficiency, high capacity. Very light, does not short-circuit in rain and can not break down. Perfect to power deep drills or to have energy on caravan expeditions.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/g59UIb0.png) Uranium battery
High efficiency, very high capacity. Unlike the previous ones this one has incredibly high stats for it's cost. It can however short-circuit in rain, explodes violently when damaged and generates a lot of heat. Temperatures above 20°C (68°F) will cause the efficiency to drop.

High efficiency, high capacity. Ultimate constructable battery, does not short-circuit in rain and does never break down.

Like the vanometric power cell, this one can only be found, not constructed. It has supreme stats, but also high market value, making it expensive to buy and attractive to raiders.
Capacity: 2500
Efficiency: 100%
